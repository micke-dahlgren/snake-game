# SNAKE GAME
This is the classic game snake made as an exercise in Java.

You can either open the project in your Java IDE of choice or run the **snake.jar** executable.

## GAME RULES
* Self collision will result in game over.
* Going beyond screen edges will teleport you to the opposite side.
* Collect the red "apples" to increase your score
* Collect the powerup to temporarily gain increased speed and immunity to self collision
